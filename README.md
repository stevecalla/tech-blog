  * DB_NAME="blog_db"
  * DB_USER="<mySQL user name>"

Seed the Database: 
- Run Server: From the root directory, run either "npm run watch" to start nodeman or "node server.js".
- Seed Database: (a) To create the database, run "SOURCE ./db/schema.sql" in mySQL, (b) To create the database tables, from the terminal, run "npm run start" or "npm run watch", (c) To seed the database tables, run "npm run seed" or "node ./seeds/index.js".

  * email: egerok3@ifeng.com, password: "password1234"
  * email: cmcglynn8@vimeo.com, password: "password1234"

If you'd like to use NPM nodemon as/if you make changes to the code, please install nodemon as a development dependency using "npm install --save-dev nodemon" (see https://www.npmjs.com/package//nodemon).
